Problem Statement: 
Your main task will be to develop a weather application that retrieves data from a weather API(OpenWeatherMap can be used) and presents current weather information for a specified location. Users should be able to easily search for cities, view current temperature, weather conditions, and other relevant details, with the flexibility to add and monitor multiple cities. 



 
Requirements: 


React Project Setup: Initialize a React project and create essential components for the weather application.


OpenWeatherMap Apis: you can use openWeatherMap Apis for receiving Data.
 
Form Component: Implement a form component enabling users to input city names. Manage input field state and handle weather data fetched from the API. 



Display Weather Information: Show current temperature, weather conditions, and additional relevant data retrieved from the API. 



City Management: Enable users to add multiple cities to their weather dashboard for convenient weather tracking. 



Error Handling: Ensure robust error handling for cases such as invalid city names or failed API requests, displaying appropriate error messages. 

 
Responsiveness: Make the application responsive to varying screen sizes and devices for optimal user experience.
